## Workday Analyst I â€“ Interview Project

This project was developed by Brayden Johnson to demonstrate the skills and responsibilities required for a Workday Analyst I position. It simulates real-world support tasks, data audits, and mass data load preparation aligned with the expectations at Freeman Health System.

## Project Overview

This project includes the following components:

### Data Audit
- **File:** `mock_employee_data_audit.xlsx`
- Created using Python and manually audited in Excel.
- Includes realistic employee data with intentional issues such as missing emails, duplicate IDs, and invalid departments.
- Each issue is labeled and documented with a proposed resolution.

### EIB Simulation
- **File:** `mass_worker_data_load_template.xlsx`
- Simulated mass data load formatted for Workday EIB-style uploads.
- Includes unique worker IDs, job titles, departments, manager names, and effective start dates.
- Generated using Python to reflect repeatable, structured data entry.

### Help Ticket Scenarios
- **File:** `ticket_scenarios_and_resolutions.pdf`
- Documents five realistic support tickets, each with a clear issue, diagnosis, and Tier 1 resolution.
- Scenarios reflect both user-facing and data-related Workday problems.

### Self-Service Documentation
- **File:** `faq_tip_sheet.pdf`
- A one-page tip sheet that reflects the type of internal documentation or knowledge base content a Workday Analyst I might contribute to reduce support ticket volume.

### Code
- **Files:** `generate_mock_data.py`, `generate_mass_data_load.py`
- Python scripts used to generate mock employee data and EIB-style files for audit and simulation purposes.

## Purpose

This project was built to reflect how I would approach key responsibilities of the Workday Analyst I role, including:
- Maintaining data accuracy
- Responding to support requests
- Preparing data for upload into HRIS systems
- Creating clear documentation for both technical and non-technical users
